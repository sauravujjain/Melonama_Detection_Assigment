## General Information
- **Objective**: The main goal is to identify melanoma, a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. This disease accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. Through the creation of a CNN-based model, the aim is to evaluate images and promptly notify dermatologists about potential melanoma presence. This not only streamlines the detection process but significantly reduces the manual effort required in diagnosis.
  
- **Business Problem**: The challenge is to ensure the accurate detection of melanoma, potentially saving lives and improving diagnostic efficiency.
  
- **Dataset**: The data being utilized is sourced from the ISIC (The International Skin Imaging Collaboration) skin cancer dataset.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.6

## Conclusions
- **Findings from Model 3**: 
    - The model's training and validation accuracy saw a marked improvement, largely attributable to strategies like data augmentation and handling class imbalance.
    - No signs of overfitting were observed, making this model viable as a final iteration.

- **Training Accuracy**: 94.12%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 83%
